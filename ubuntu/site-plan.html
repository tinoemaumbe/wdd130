        Charity begins at home but should not end. Together we can help the need children and save a nation. It's not the things that can be bought that are life's richest treasures, bringing a smile to someone, cheerful giving, a sympathetic ear, these are priceless little treasures from the storehouse of our Lord and the giver finds rich copmense in giving. Let's hold hands and fend those homeless children in need. Sponsor a child with money, food and water, clothes and anything you wish to give out.When you sponsor a child, you create a powerful multiplier effect. You help them see beyond the daily struggles of life in poverty. HOPE FOR HUMANITY. TOGETHER WE CAN.
