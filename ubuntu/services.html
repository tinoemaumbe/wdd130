    <p>At our organisation we offer different kind of services to these children. It's not not always giving out food but its all how you built these children. At our organisation we offer services such as education, we teach these children some coarses and also provide guidence and councling as well as hear their stories and try to help them. At our organisation the focus is not only feeding them but on creating specialised education activities and workshops that can bridge formal and non-formal education, creating classroom environments and training teachers in methods that support inclusive education. Providing shelter is also one of our services we offer for children have a right to shelter. </p>
